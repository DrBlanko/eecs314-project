About input.bin
---------------

The faces of the Rubik's Cube are represented as an array of bytes in
input.bin. Each byte indicates the color of that position. The faces are
read in phone-keypad order. The faces are listed in the following order:

Front, Right, Back, Left, Underside (or Bottom), Top

Thus, the flattening of the cube can be seen as:

  T
L F R B
  U
  
Or, when mapped to the actual values:

            45 46 47
            48 49 50
            51 52 53
            
27 28 29    00 01 02    09 10 11    18 19 20
30 31 32    03 04 05    12 13 14    21 22 23
33 34 35    06 07 08    15 16 17    24 25 26

            36 37 38
            39 40 41
            42 43 44

The valid colors are 0x1, 0x2, 0x3, 0x4, 0x5, and 0x6.
Each face's middle must be a distinct value.
