About input.bin
---------------

The faces of the Rubik's Cube are represented as an array of bytes in
input.bin. Each byte indicates the color of that position. The faces are
read in phone-keypad order. The faces are listed in the following order:

Front, Right, Back, Left, Down, Upper

Thus, the flattening of the cube can be seen as:

  U
L F R
  D
  B
  
Or, when mapped to the actual values:

            45 46 47
            48 49 50
            51 52 53
            
27 28 29    00 01 02    09 10 11    
30 31 32    03 04 05    12 13 14    
33 34 35    06 07 08    15 16 17    

            36 37 38
            39 40 41
            42 43 44

            18 19 20
            21 22 23
            24 25 26

The valid colors are:

Color#  Color Name  Center Piece
0x1     Red         04 - Front
0x2     Blue        13 - Right
0x3     Orange      22 - Back
0x4     Green       31 - Left
0x5     Yellow      40 - Down
0x6     White       49 - Upper

Instructions for running:
-------------------------
1. Set the input.bin file to reflect the initial
   state of the cube, using a hex editor, following
   the specification above.
   
2. (Optional) Clear the output.txt file, rendering it
   blank. However, the file must still exist.
   
3. From a command line, navigate to this directory.

4. Start qtspim.

5. Load the "source.s" file.

6. Run the file.

7. Open the output.txt file and observe the results.
